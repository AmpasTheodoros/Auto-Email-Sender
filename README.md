# Auto-Email-Sender

DISCLAIMER
you can send pictures or any kind of file you can only type your email

Requirements:

First of all you're going to
want to have an email account to send emails

You can use any email service that you'd like but the setup might be slightly different

if you're using Gmail then there are a couple of settings that you need to change in order to send emails through python using your account

if you don't have two factor authentication setup then you're going to need to allow lesssecure applications like python to connect to your account and you can do
that at this URL here https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqblVwQkRxSl9iMFJCN2ZzbXo2SzE1Y2Rkcmc2QXxBQ3Jtc0tuSzB6Ui1LamJyTDkzeUE0ckxLUFV1bVhRcnJSX1BDWVFmMTFIbi1QRnZ4TWNrQWZaYU1Nal9oNmd5NVVFRUNNNHNubWh6anhZNW9JS1I0NHJ0dGcwVnBSalhJNndrR0hBaGpZbzNRMlB4QmpHei10TQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2Flesssecureapps

if you do have two-factor authentication which I would always recommend then instead you'll need to create an app password so that you can connect through Python and you will do that at this URL here https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEFZZnlFa3dEbXNoeGI5ZjBpakFWYm1OaHhvUXxBQ3Jtc0tuSVkwUGxIV3h2alA2clZ3Yl9CbFRRdW5DSXhRRlZwQXVjMFp2aDJIbFRpU0k1aGhFbkJfLTZSTFFOZ1lPb05QemZ5QmdMTTJiZkVENDFzcjR5TVlocnhrNVBmRGE0bHhHQ3poVGVFck9qNkwzV19WWQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2Fapppasswords

Set Up The Program:

First of you have to make a new folder and add the program and the exel

Second in the line 9 and 10 of the program you have to add the email and the password (make sure that it inside the " " and  you have successfully complete all the requirements)

Third at the end of the line 18 you have to add the name of the exel inside the " " (make sure that the name ends with .xls (if for some reason you cant add the exel in the same folder with the program you have to add the entire path to find the exel and add a second "/" so the path is gonna look like this C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\\name.xls)
